# dataracebench by GitHub Copilot

These tests indicate that GitHub Copilot is unable to recognize IO statements and dependencies.

Time of testing: 11-29-2023

We allowed Copilot to match public code.

Here is the how we used Copilot: we select a loop and pass the following sentence

```
Check this loop to see if it is parallelizable. A parallelizable loop should contain no data dependency and no IO statement. If the loop is parallelizable, parallelize it using OpenMP.
```
